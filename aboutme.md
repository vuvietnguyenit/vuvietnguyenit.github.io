My name is Vu Nguyen

If you following career path about Development/Operation system, this blog is for you.
Everything in here can partly help you see the work you are doing from different perspectives. That will help you develop better on your career path.

I'm not in a "teach" someone aspect doing something. This blog base on experience I had receive during work in recent years. So, everything I wrote here from more "individual" perspectives. So it is inevitable that it may be true for me, but not true for you and if you may share your perspectives, I will "listen and learn". I would be very grateful for that.

**Something I like:**

- Girls
- Violin
- Sun
- Sea

What else do you need ?
