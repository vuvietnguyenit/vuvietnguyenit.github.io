Recently, I felt tired and have many bad emotions because I working with MS Teams, Telegram has been banned in Vietnam recently. So, my team move to this platform of MS, I very hate that, in my opinion that is fucking platform, even it doesn‚Äôt exists on Linux. Damn it!!. As a SRE, I don‚Äôt want to do tasks related to Microsoft Platforms, I like UNIX, I like command-line interface, I want to use programing language or script to resolve my problem, not Drag/Drop and my co-workers don‚Äôt like MS as well. MS Teams can be familiar with almost standards users but if you do tasks related to interaction with Teams‚Äôs API, Workflow, Push-notification problems ‚Ä¶

I felt so damn pissed, I swore way too many times because of it üôÇ, even though my boss was sitting right next to me.

We don‚Äôt want to add more platform related to messaging jobs, I think we just need one. And then, we decided to choose MS Teams, and this make a lot of fucking emotion problem to me üòÑ.

My boss and I have some discussions about: ‚ÄúHow we can help another teams can subscribe ours alerts, they can have full control with their alerts as they want, then we (my team) don‚Äôt do more anything, we need to focus on operation job, make the system reliable, secure and fast,‚Ä¶‚Äù Or, we just go to the office, have some talks, then go to swim at lunch, read some books in the afternoon and go home with their wife (or many wife) or pick some lucky girls to go out at night ü•∞ (very true, i like it).

Back to my story. I think i have a good design to my Alertmanager system as my above idea, i will write up about it in another day, but most of problem related to Teams‚Äôs Workflow, Mobile push-notification, and I had some smart idea to improve it to better. It took away a lot of my joy over the past few days. I did get something back when I solved the problem though it felt like an unequal trade-off.

I can't believe this is how a message is created and sent in MS Teams. I don‚Äôt like C#, so I hate it, and I have no intent to learn it, although I must write some expressions to interact with data structure in this job, this isn‚Äôt problem with me.

Let‚Äôs throw these things out off my self when I finish this task.
