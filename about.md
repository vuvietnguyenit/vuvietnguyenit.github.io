title: About me
subtitle: Are you a Linux, Perf, Security, or Computer System-holic?
---
I’m Vu - a curious SRE who loves diving deep into Linux internals, performance tuning, and eBPF magic. Most of my time is spent exploring how systems behave under pressure (and occasionally, why they break).
This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share notes, experiments, and lessons learned from my daily work in reliability, observability, and performance.
Besides SRE life, I’m also passionate about Security and Exploitation research - with some past experience building threat intelligence platforms and playing around with low-level systems.
You’ll find a mix of serious tech deep dives, casual thoughts, and maybe a few rants. I write freely here - no strict formats, no corporate tone - just honest experience from the trenches.
